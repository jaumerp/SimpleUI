# SimpleUI
<p>A simplified Blizzard interface based on the original system.<p>

<p><b>Some features:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Hide/Show BagSlots and Microbuttons</li>
  <li>New Sliders to Fade and Move BagSlots and Microbuttons.</li>
  <li>Quest Tracker movable by the user. New fade and resize option.</li>
  <li>Customized Chat: <i>Relocate the ChatFrameEditBox to the top of the chat and a few more improvements added.</i></li>
  <li>Hide/Show OrderHallCommandBar</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
